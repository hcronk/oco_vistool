# oco_vistool.py

The purpose of this script is to pull different RGB images (depending on the user's choice from Encoding.csv) from Worldview using the NASA GIBS API and overlay various OCO-2/3 data fields for 
case study analysis in support of OCO-2/3 cloud and aerosol screening validation.

It can be used as a command line tool to plot any data in the OCO-2/3 CO2 or SIF Lite file, filtered by warn level, quality flag, and/or footprint number where applicable.  
It can also be called as a function from within another Python program for expanded use with other datasets.

## GETTING STARTED

1) Clone this code \
   `git clone http://github.com/hcronk/oco2_modis_vistool`
   
   We suggest obtaining the package via a `git clone` rather than downloading the tarball because
   the tool is still under active development. A clone will enable you to quickly update your copy 
   to the current stable version using a `git pull` command on your end, rather than downloading 
   and comparing files.  

2) Make sure you have the necessary system and Python requirements.
    #### Option 1: Conda Environment 

    ##### Miniconda Installation Instructions:
    - Linux: https://www.cira.colostate.edu/wiki/miniconda-python-distribution-on-linux/
    - Mac: https://www.cira.colostate.edu/wiki/miniconda-python-distribution-on-mac/
    - Windows: https://www.cira.colostate.edu/wiki/miniconda-python-distribution-on-windows/
    
    From the cloned directory, run `conda env create -f environment.yml` to create the conda environment. To activate the environment, use `conda activate oco_vistool` and to deactivate, use `conda deactivate`. More information about working with conda environments can be found at https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html

    #### Option 2: Docker Container
    The Dockerfile included in the repository can be used to create an appropriate Docker image and container environment.
    
    ##### Building the image
    Build the image using the command `docker build -t oco_vistool:1.0 .`
    Although the tag (`-t`) is optional, it will assign a name and version to
    the resulting image which will make it easily locatable and also provide
    a mechanism to have multiple versions available for testing and using
    upgrades. Note the `.` assumes you are working in the directory that
    contains the Dockerfile. To provide an alternate path, trade the period
    out for `-f /path/to/the/Dockerfile`

    ##### Creating a container from the image
    Although the default Docker behavior will create a container that runs
    as root, it is best practice to declare your own user when you create
    the container to avoid messy security issues. For compatability with
    the host machine, you can use your user and preferred group ids in the
    container, or if compatability is not an issue, you may simply create a new user:group identification for the container. To get your user and group id
    on the host (provided that you are working in a linux-like environment), use
    `id -u [user name]` and `id -g [group name]`.

    To create and run a container from the image, use
    `docker run -it --name oco_vistool -u uid:gid -v /path/to/data/on/host:/path/to/data/in/the/container oco_vistool:1.0`,
    adding -v flags before the image name as necessary to provide any data mounts
    needed for the code to be able to access the necessary input data.
    Again, the `--name` is optional but makes the container easily locatable.

    ##### Entering the container
    The `-it` flag in the `docker build` command will start an interactive
    session within the container, where you will be dropped in the
    `/ECO1280_int_scripts` directory where the conversion scripts are located.
    If the container is stopped (you can check by running `docker ps`),
    start it by running `docker start oco_vistool` and then enter it
    using `docker exec -it oco_vistool /bin/bash`.    

3) Test run from the command line  
   `python oco_vistool.py`


4) Look for the output PNG and HDF5 in the code directory

5) Update the JSON configuration file with information from your scene of interest. Options include:
   #### Required:
     **date** (string, format:"YYYY-MM-DD"):  
         The date of your case study. This is used to get the correct RGB. 

     **geo_upper_left** (list, format:[lat, lon]):  
         The latitude and longitude coordinates of the upper left hand corner of your area of 
         interest.

     **geo_lower_right** (list, format:[lat, lon]):  
         The latitude and longitude coordinates of the lower right hand corner of your area of 
         interest.
     **sensor** (string):
         The sensor name that is desired to be used for the background image. Supported sensors at the moment are: 
         "Worldview", "GOES16_ABI_C", "GOES16_ABI_F", "GOES17_ABI_C", "GOES17_ABI_F".
   #### Required if the sensor field, required above, is "Worldview" (otherwise, not needed):
     **layer** (integer, format: integer between 0 and maximum code number in Encoding.csv):
         The code of the background layer to be used by the vistool. Each layer is given its code (encoded) 
         in the Encoding.csv file in the code directory. The file contains the relation: layer name (by the
         NASA Worldview standards) - code (generated unique number). So, when adding new
         layers to the CSV, use the above standards.

   #### Optional:
	**region** (string, default: none):  
    	The region of your case study. This is used to build the default output filename in the 
        command line execution.

     **cmap** (string, default: "jet"):  
       The desired colormap or color for the overlay data.  
       Built-in colormap options can be found here:

            		maximum value]):  
            		The maximum and minimum values used for plotting and color assignment. Any data values 
            		beyond the min and max will show up on the plot as the minimum or maximum color,

## Other Information

GIBS developer documentation:  https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/GIBS/GIBS+API+for+Developers

#### WMTS Capabilities File and Its Parser
There is a script in the code directory called "parse_wmts.py" which parses the wmts.xml capabilities file. The
reason of this Python parser is to get the relation, layer name - layer specifications XML url, for all NASA Worldview
layers (as of June 2021) into a separate CSV file. This relation CSV file is used for plotting and styling the output image.
The parser used a copy of the wmts capabilities file which was downloaded into the code directory from: https://gibs.earthdata.nasa.gov/wmts/epsg4326/best/wmts.cgi?SERVICE=WMTS&REQUEST=GetCapabilities

#### AWS functionality (Keys.csv file)
When either GOES or Himawari is chosen as the desired sensor in the config JSON file, there will appear a required key, such as the "files_loc". Two options (as of July 2021) for this key are: "aws" and "local". If the user wants to use the AWS S3 NOAA bucket as the source of background imagery, one would need to provide a Keys.csv file in the code directory. The file must have 2 columns with names: aws_access_key_id,aws_secret_access_key. Then, the user should provide each of the keys under the corresponding columns. To have these keys, one would need to create an AWS account and then generate both keys (or have an account with these keys being active).
Full instruction on this process can be found in the "Programmatic access" part of the AWS documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html

Minimum command line call:  
`python oco_vistool.py`


Minimum function call:  
```
from oco_vistool import do_overlay_plot

do_overlay_plot([lat_of_upper_lefthand_corner, lon_of_upper_lefthand_corner],
                [lat_of_lower_righthand_corner, lon_of_lower_righthand_corner], 
                date, lat_data, lon_data, variable_data)
```
